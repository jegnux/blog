<img src="/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" style="width: 120px; float:left; margin: 10px 20px 200px 0px "/>I'm Jérôme Alves, an iOS developer since 2010. I develop mainly in Swift since 2014, just a few months after its launch.

I'm currently Lead iOS Developer at [Heetch](http://heetch.com) where I continuously modernize the codebase while introducing new features to let thousands of drivers and passengers enjoy going out :wink:
