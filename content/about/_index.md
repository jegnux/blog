<img src="/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px auto 50px auto; display: block;"/>I'm Jérôme Alves, an iOS developer since 2010 living in south of France near Toulouse. I develop in Swift as my primary language since 2014, just a few months after it was launched.

I'm currently Lead iOS Developer at [<span style="color: #f80059; font-weight:bold;">Heetch</span>](http://heetch.com) where I continuously help to modernize the codebase while introducing new features to let thousands of drivers and passengers enjoy going out :wink:.

I'm very happy with my current job so I'm not available for hire, but if you're interested by what we are doing, you should take a look to our [job offer](https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/03875a59-c16f-4425-8161-288499837167).
